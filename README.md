# Loco - Spatial Viewer

A simple web application to view spatial data from various formats like GeoJSON, WKT, and WKB.

## Local Development

To run and test the application on your local machine, follow these steps.

### 1. Installation

First, install the necessary Node.js dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Running the Application

This application uses ES modules, which require a web server to run correctly. We have included a simple server for convenience.

To start the local development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will serve the application on `http://localhost:8080`. You can open this URL in your browser to use the viewer.

### 3. Running Tests

The project includes a test suite for the spatial data parser. To run the tests, use:

```bash
npm test
```
